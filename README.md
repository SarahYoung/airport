I am writing software and tests to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.

This is the Week 3 Exam at Makers Academy.

# Feedback

The plane doesn't actually land when you call
```
airport.dock(plane)
```
see new failing test

There is limited interaction between classes, the airport and the plane need to talk to each other currently  you have two things that don't really come together to do anything as a system.

weather.rb and weather_spec.rb are empty, clean up your mess!
